### Input and Output Operations in C++
C++ comes with libraries that provide us with many ways for performing input and output. In C++ input and output are performed in the form of a sequence of bytes or more commonly known as streams.

- Input Stream: If the direction of flow of bytes is from the device(for example, Keyboard) to the main memory then this process is called input.
- Output Stream: If the direction of flow of bytes is opposite, i.e. from main memory to device( display screen ) then this process is called output.

### Header files available in C++ for Input/Output operations are: 

- iostream: iostream stands for standard input-output stream. This header file contains definitions of objects like cin, cout, cerr, etc.
- iomanip: iomanip stands for input-output manipulators. The methods declared in these files are used for manipulating streams. This file contains definitions of setw, setprecision, etc.
