### What is a variable?
A variable in simple terms is a storage place that has some memory allocated to it. Basically, a variable is used to store some form of data. Different types of variables require different amounts of memory, different type of memory locations, and some specific set of operations that can be applied to them. 

### Points to remember for variable name:
are case sensitive
variable names can use numbers,letters and underscore
variable names cannot have special characters like !,%,$
variable names cannot start with a number
variable names cannot use reserved keyword like int,char,bool,include
No whitespace is allowed within the variable name

All variables use data-type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored. Therefore, we can say that data types are used to tell the variables the type of data it can store. Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data type with which it is declared. Every data type requires a different amount of memory.

C++ supports a wide variety of data types and the programmer can select the data type appropriate to the needs of the application. Data types specify the size and types of value to be stored. However, storage representation and machine instructions to manipulate each data type differ from machine to machine, although C++ instructions are identical on all machines.

#### C++ supports the following data types:

**1.Primary or Built in or Fundamental data type       
2.Derived data types       
3.User defined data types**          

We will not discuss 2. and 3. in Week 1.         
**1. Primitive Data Types:** These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char, float, bool, etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are: 

- Integer    
- Character      
- Boolean       
- Floating Point      
- Double Floating Point       
- Valueless or Void      
- Wide Character  
### Data Type Modifiers in C++
Modifiers are used in C++ to change or give extra meaning to database types. Itâ€™s added to primitive data types as a prefix to change their meaning. A modifier is used to change the meaning of a basic type so that it better matches the requirements of different circumstances.                      
                      
Following are the C++ data type modifiers:                 

- signed
- unsigned
- long
- short
