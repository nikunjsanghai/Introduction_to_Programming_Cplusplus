### What is Syntax?
It is the correct way to write a code. 

### What is an IDE?
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Just as writers use text editors and accountants use spreadsheets, software developers use IDEs to make their job easier.

### What is a compiler?
A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language. The source code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable language such as Java or C++. A programmer writes the source code in a code editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) that includes an editor, saving the source code to one or more text files. A compiler that supports the source programming language reads the files, analyzes the code, and translates it into a format suitable for the target platform.

Compilers that translate source code to machine code target specific operating systems and computer architectures. This type of output is sometimes referred to as object code (which is not related to object-oriented programming). The outputted machine code is made up entirely of binary bits -- 1s and 0s -- so it can be read and executed by the processors on the target computers. For example, a compiler might output machine code for the Linux x64 platform or Linux ARM 64-bit platform. [Link](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/compiler)

### What are Header files?
These are those files that store predefined functions. It contains definitions of functions that you can include or import using a preprocessor directive #include. This preprocessor directive tells the compiler that the header file needs to be processed prior to the compilation. For example, the <iostream> header file in C++ contains the definition of input-output functions.

### Why Do You Use Header Files?
Header files are used in C++ so that you donâ€™t have to write the code for every single thing. It helps to reduce the complexity and number of lines of code. It also gives you the benefit of reusing the functions that are declared in header files to different .cpp files and including a header file is way easier than writing the implementations. By using a header file, you keep the program precise and focused, which makes it manageable.

### What is pre-processor? 
We will not go into that for now,but if you are interested, you can read about it here. [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cc-preprocessors/)
