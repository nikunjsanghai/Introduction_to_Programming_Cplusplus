### Operators in C++
An operator is a symbol that operates on a value to perform specific mathematical or logical computations. They form the foundation of any programming language.
In C++, we have built-in operators to provide the required functionality.
### Operators in C++ can be classified into 6 types:
- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Ternary or Conditional Operators

### Arithmetic Operators
These operators are used to perform arithmetic or mathematical operations on the operands. For example, ‘+’ is used for addition, ‘-‘ is used for subtraction ‘*’ is used for multiplication, etc.
