```
//output:
Enter a number:10 //Input
Average:10
Enter a number:20 //Input
Average:15 
Enter a number:30 //Input
Average:20 
Enter a number:20 //Input
Average:20 
Enter a number:100// Input
Average:36
//End of execution
```
**Question 2**: Enter a number and check if the number is a prime number or not. (0,1 is not accepted as an input. Print invalid input if the number is negative or 0 or 1). Definition: Prime number is a number which has exactly 2 divisors (1 and the number itself)

Sum of Digits:6 
```
Case 2:
```
Enter a number: 78901
Sum of Digits:25
```

**Question 4**: Enter a program to input a string and calculate the number of blank spaces, the number of lower case characters and the number of upper case characters in the string. 


Example: 
```
getline(cin,s);//s=abcde GHJK Uu 
```
Output: 
```
The number of lower_case characters are:6
The number of upper_case characters are:5
The number of blank_spaces are:3
```
**Question 5**: Enter a code to check if the string input is 4 in length. If it is 4 in length then replace all the vowels in the word with *, otherwise display an error message. 
```
Sample input: AaAa
Sample output: ****
Sample input: abcde
Sample output: ERROR!!

**Question 5**: Write a program to enter a principal amount, enter the interest rate and if the interest given is more than 600 dollars for one year display the balance along with the message "Interest earned is more than  600 dollars needs to be reported to the IRS" 
```
Sample input: Principal: 1000
Interest: 4.00
Output: Balance after 1 year= 1040

Interest: 4.00
Output: Balance after 1 year = 104000
Interest earned is more than  600 dollars needs to be reported to the IRS
```

**Question 6**: Write a program to calculate a grade for a student, take an input "S/US" or "Graded" or otherwise display an error. If is "S/US" then enter a score out of 100 , if it more than 40 , display S otherwise US. If it is graded enter a score out of 100 and calculate the grade based on the following metric 
| Marks         | Grade         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 100-90  | A  |
| 89-80  | B  |
